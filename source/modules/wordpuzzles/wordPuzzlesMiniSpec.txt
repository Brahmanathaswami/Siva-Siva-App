Puzzle View: Selected quote is tile and randomly shuffled
	-- this is pretty much all working, 
	
Completion View: 
	-- Button appears "Read in Context"  # I know I said "info icon" but I think it is beter to be more clear... so just put a button for now.
	-- Dialog "You Did It! X number of words in N minutes and N seconds. use settings to get longer quotes."  with "OK"
	-- on "OK" clear puzzle and fetch new random background.
	JG: can't clear board on completion, else "Read in context" doesn't make sense. Will clear on New Puzzle instead.
