<p>Unjumble word puzzles offers a fun way to explore quotations and absorb bite-sized bits of wisdom. Your job is to drag scattered tiles into proper order. A starting arrow in the upper left shows where to drop the first word.<br /></p>

<p>Use the <i>Settings,</i> button to control the difficulty of the puzzles. Higher levels have more words.<br /></p>

<p>Once you have completed a puzzle, if the "eye" button appears in the upper right, you can click to read the quote in it's original context. Note that not all quotes link back to a book.  A timer will tell you how long it took you to finish.<br /></p>

<p><b>Puzzle Tips</b><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Almost all quotes start with a capital letter</li>
<li>Tirumantiram quotes start with a number like this "245:"</li>
<li>If the same word, like "the" or "of" appears several times, you must place the correct one in the correct spot. If it seems like it should be "the" then choose a different "the".</li>
<li>The word tile will glow when it is near its proper position, let go and it will snap into place.</li>
<li>Word tiles that are in place have no border.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cover over your words. You cannot grab a tile that is under one already in place. If there is a word underneath your glowing tile, first move your glowing tile away, then move the word underneath to the outside or top, and then move the first tile into position.</li>
</ul>
