 Image Puzzle game
 
 Sendan Boys' ideas
 
 1) have to finish all sets from 4 pcs to 36 piece
 2) each set has to be finished in a certain amount of time.
 3) then you get a new puzzle.... 
 
 4) track your score 
 5) Global score board on line, showing various players.. 
 6)  in a certain amount of time to get a new puzzle.


Sounds: when puzzle piece locks in... 

Audio settings: turn audio on or off
Music on

button clicks, snap in place clicks, completion music 

two settings for older and younger kids.

Younger get longer times and less pieces to get a new image

Add a new image each month

try graphing users times to get a baseline for time it takes to finish
