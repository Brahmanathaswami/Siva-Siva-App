script "behavior_Listen"

-----------------------------------------------------
#  behavior_Listen
#
# DESCRIPTION
# this behavior is the /modules/listen/listen.livecode stack script
# It's primary function is to handle high level calls to get play lists
# UI consist of 3 main cards
# listen-collections - shows a catalog of songs built up on a 
# collection.json for: it in be built from a development stack tools
# listen-browse - Later for show in play list
# listen-my-music  # for music that is no loaded
#
# So as not to over load this script the handlers whose scope deals with
# user interaction with a single play list/ indivdtual songs are in a separate behavior 
#
# behavior_ListenSelectPlay
# assigned to the listen-browse card
#
# PARAMS: Main variable sent to this script is a string JSONl list 
#  which is the name/title of all the collections

# playList_FetchData
# DESCRIPTION: 
-- # all the dataquery data it in to json file under "data-query"
-- # we have three classes of lists based on data storage/CMS
-- # each requires a different query
-- # 1. Remote list: send JSON to server we send JSON for remote list
-- # 2.  Audiobook: build a path string and download index. json for audio books
-- # 3. query the local dbase for already cached metadata in the Local Jnanam dbase
-- # These are merged into a sPlaylistQueryA   array the we use pass date to the 
-- # dbase handlers
-- # we need max six criteria to search our metadata, not all playlists require all strings, 
-- # but our query array will still have all these keys; use elements as needed
-- # we will model that array into a json string or dbase query later
-- # media_type, author, artist, record-type [latest | cached | audiobook], num-of-records,year, file_id
-- # see /system/applications/ha/controllers/API3.lc  on the server for details on the remote call
-- #  structure of remote query, for reference:
-- # Note we use "recordType" here instead of "playlistClass" because the API  pon the server is agnostic about the type
-- # of records we are fetching... it could be artwork quotes, books anything... not only audio playLists.
-- #   put "{'data': {'media_type': 'inspiredtalk','author':'Bodhinatha'},'recordType':'latest','recordCount':'30'}" into tJSON
-- #
-- # We keep all the data in json file now.

-- # Audio books are simpler, all we need is a path to the remote server directory, fetch the audio JSON file therein.
-- # 
-- # Sorting differs by playlistClass: latest | descending by date, audiobook | per json index, cached | alpha by title or file_ID
-- # usually trigger on arrival to this stack-card

-- # PARAMS: pass numeric collection and the playlist from /modules/listen/collection.json file
-- # CHANGES: 2018-04-09 - BR Created
