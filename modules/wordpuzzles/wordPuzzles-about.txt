<p>Unjumble word puzzles offers a fun way to explore quotations and absorb bite-sized bits of wisdom. Your job is to drag scattered tiles into proper order. A starting arrow in the upper left shows where to drop the first word.<br /></p>

<p>Use the <i>Settings,</i> button to control the difficulty of the puzzles. Higher levels have more words.<br /></p>

<p>Once you have completed a puzzle, if the "eye" button appears in the upper right, you can click to read the quote in it's original context. Note that not all quotes link back to a book.  A timer will tell you how long it took you to finish.<br /></p>

<p><b>Puzzle Tips</b><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Almost all quotes start with a capital letter</li>
<li>Tirumantiram quotes start with a number like this "245:"</li>
<li>The word tile will glow when it is near its proper position, let go and it will snap into place. If it glows and you drag it way... it may still not be in place so move it again until it snaps in place and bht border goes away</li>
<li>Word tiles that are in place have no border.</li>
<li>Use "Reveal" to show the quote for 2 second. It the future you will lose points each time you use "Reveal"
</ul>
<p>* We hope to fix this in a future version so that any "of" will work. But for you must find the right one.</p>
