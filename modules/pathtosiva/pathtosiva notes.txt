Notes:

11/30/16
Worked around a LC bug when setting the vScroll of the TOC.

11/27/16
Changed all references to "chapter" to "lesson" and updated all lesson text. Revised TOC. Added "Choose Your Path" card with icons and appropriate navigation handlers. Adjusted position of Gurudeva quote in some particular lessons.

11/20/16
Module is now mobilized. SetPref and getPref work but are session-only for now.

11/16/16
Path to Siva is not yet mobile-ready and has only been run on desktop. It is only partially complete and has only basic features so far. It was placed into the git repository for feedback on visual and behavioral features. More to follow later.

SetPref and getPref are disabled for now until I know the correct parameters to send.
