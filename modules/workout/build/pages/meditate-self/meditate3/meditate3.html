    <h3 text-center >Step 4: Become Aware of the Nerve Currents</h3>
            <p>Further Reading: <br/>The next step is to feel the nerve currents of the body. There are thousands of miles of nerve currents in each of us. Donâ€™t try to feel them all at once. Start with the little ones, with the feeling of the hands, thumbs touching, resting on your lap. Now feel the life force going through these nerves, energizing the body. Try to sense the even more subtle nerves that extend out and around the body about three or four feet. This may take a long time. When you have located some of these nerves, feel the energy within them. Tune into the currents of life force as they flow through these nerves. This is a subtle feeling, and most likely awareness will wander into some other area of the mind. When this happens, gently bring it back to your point of concentration, to feeling the nerves within the body and the energy within the nerves.</p>
