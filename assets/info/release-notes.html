<p>Optimized for 9 X 16 (portrait orientation) or 16 X 9 screens</p>

<p>By design, the content is opltimized for mobile phones. The app will run on tablets, but much of the content is, again, by design, non-responsive. This means 3 X 4 tablets will see the content rendered in a 16 X 9 area.</p>

<p><b><font color="#673227">Navigation Model/Portals</font></b></p>
<p> Based on our focus group studies, Version one's entry point is the home screen, which is divided into eight "Portals." The first two provide one or two clicks to content for users on the go, for that one minute at the bus stop or down time during a meeting. The other portals take you to second-level navigation. From there you can access specific website areas or view in-app modules. The eight portals are: </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Tap to View Photos: </b>We will be offering a complete user guide in future releases. But one pointer is that we have rich still imagery throughout the app. In most contexts you can tap on the image to see the full image, or a cropped view or see the image behind the text. Try it, for example, right here: click outside the text on the photo and then click again to return to the app. One goal of this app is to provide uplifting and often stunning imagery.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Gems: </b>This is a one click to content module for users on the go. The entirety of the Trilogy books, Dancing with Siva, Living with Siva and Merging with Siva, Vedic quotes and more have been extracted into small quotes. These are categorized into three realms: Realm of God, Realm of Soul and Realm of Life. Random selections are delivered along with random images. If you have a live internet connection, you can click the icon and be presented with the chapter of the book from which the quote was taken.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Surprise Me: </b> This is another one-click-to-content module. It will bring up a randomly selected  quote, an audio or video clip, or a darshan image.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Listen: </b>You do need to be online to stream the audio. Version one provides in-app curated play lists. Later we will offer a download option to save files on your phone.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Color Meditation: </b> The first of many "Practice" modules, this is a simple color-based meditation practice that Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami taught.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Daily Master Course Lesson</b> This is our popular daily study, widely accessed on our website and through email subscription, now available in the app whether you have an internet connection or not.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Path to Siva: </b>  Under the Read portal, click on <i>Path to Siva</i> to access the entire youth catechism without being on line.   </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Word Puzzles: </b> Under the Fun &amp; Games portal we have only one item at present. Be careful, this word puzzle game is addictive. We welcome your feedback on how to make it better.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Journal: </b> Click the star button to open the Journal. This feature is designed to track your activities inside the app. You can filter, set favorites, look at past activity and pick up from where left off whether in a book or an area of the website pages.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Hinduism Today Magazine</b> The entire magazine is available in the app, if you are online. (Note that the Journal does not track your viewing of the magazine. It will indicate you that you were at the magazine, but not where or what article you viewed last.)</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Website Pages</b> All other links currently take you to the most popular pages on our Himalayan Academy website. </p>
