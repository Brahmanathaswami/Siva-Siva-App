<li>Optimized for 9 X16 (portrait orientation) or 16 X 9 screens</li>
<li>By design, content is targeting phones. The app will run on tablets, but much of the content is, again, by design, non- responsive. This means 3 X 4 tablets will see the content rendered in a 16 X 9 area.</li>

<p><b><font color="#673227">Navigation Model/Portals</font></b></p>

<p> Based on our focus group studies Version 1's entry point is the home screen which is divided into eight "Portals". The first two provide 1 or two clicks to content for people on the go. If you just have a minute at the busstop or down time during a meeting. The other portals take you to second navigation level. From there you can access specific web site areas or view in-app modules. The Portals are: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gems: </b> One click to content</li>

<p><b>Tap to View Photos: </b>We will be offering a complete user guide at some point. But one pointer is that we have rich still imagery throughout the app. In most contexts you can tap on the image to see the full image, or a cropped view or see the image behind the text. Try it, for example, right here: click outside the text on the photo and then click again to return to the app. One goal of this app is to provide uplifting and often very stunning imagery.</p>
<p></p></li>
<li><b>Gems: </b>This is a one click to content module for users on the go. The entirety of the Trilogy books, Dancing with Siva, Living with Siva and Merging with Siva, Vedic quotes and more. have been extracted into small quotes. These are future categorized into three realms: Realm of God, Realm of Soul and Realm of Life. Random selections are delivered along with random images. If you have an internet connection you can read the chapter of the book from which the quote was taken, instantly, without having to navigation to some ebook reading context.<p></p></li>
<li><b>Surprise Me: </b> This is another one-click-to-content module. You be taken to either a quote, audio, video, art or darshan image random selection.<p></p></li>
<li><b>Listen: </b>User demand for audio content is very high. You do need to be online to stream the audio. Version one provides in-app curated play lists. We hope develop this audio world into a rich interface as time goes on for the "ear buds" generation, and for the long commutes where you can send audio to your care speaker wirelessly. Later we will offer a download option to save files on your phone.<p></p></li>

Though the journal will tell you that you were at the magazine, just not where or what article you viewed last.<p></p></li>
<li><b>Web Site Pages</b> All other links currently take you to the most popular pages on our web site. This was one user request, to have directly mobile access, but with a more pre-curated index for the key pages users look at regularly.  Over time much of the web content will appear in more native app curated views as we develop them.</li>
