<p><b>Release Candidate 4 (RC34) <br />Updates and Changes</b><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>RC4  adds search to the Listen module. Since we exposed our entire audio collection in-app, we need a quick way, in Version 1, to allow users to search. Click the "More" icon (3 vertical dots) which will appear when you access the Songs or All Bodhinatha or All Gurudeva Talks. when you see them (not needed for audio books or e "latest"). We also upgraded our in-app notification to follow the Googles Material Design UI Toast specification: a small panel rise from the bottom of the screen with message you need to see and then slide back down.  iOS users are encourage to try everything any problems with the next 72 hours. On Tuesdays or Wednesday of next week we will submit the app for approval to Apple's App store. So anything you find that is a bug, let us know as soon as possible. ANDROID USERS:  the app is  fully functional with some small anomalies. Please report in  minute detail exact what you see and when. Please DO NOT user the Android hardward buttons for Home (round button) or the App Switcher (square). If you do, when you return, the app will stop. Nothing "bad" happens, but you would need to reboot SivaSiva app on your phone. This is a known issues on Android and we are working on it. We  encourage you to try the all aspects of the app without touching those two buttons, and report back anything you discover that is not working properly.</li>
	<li>RC3 has a single feature addition you can now download audio. Files are saved to your phone and you can play back without being on line. Items listedn in green have been cached and can be played without an internet connection.</li>
	<li>RC2 included updates to the journal and word puzzle and more audio play lists. </li>
	<li>RC1 is feature frozen. But enhancement and feature requests are encourage and will be taken into consideration for the roadmap for future versions. </li>
	<li> We are primarily interested in any bugs or failures. iOS appears to work well, assuming you have bandwidth. Android has some issues here and there. We will appreciate our Android users testing all features and send feedback.
	<li>Audio is now persistent across the app,  it will also run when your phone 's screen is dimmed.</li>
	<li>To stop the audio, click on the settings gear and tap the audio icon</li>
	<li> By popular demand the four square icon was changed to  "home" icon</li>
	<li> Surprise module was upgraded extensively to allow you to move to other verses, artwork, darshan, or audio. This feature will not be made available for video. But audio view is logged in the journal. Use the white, right facing chevron/arrow at the top of Surprise Me screens to go to another random item.</li>
	<li> art and darshan photos should now alway appear in a proper aspect ratio. Tap to shrink or expand big images. Use you finger to drag around to see parts of a large image. Please report experience of images being distorted (squashed vertically or sideways)</li>
	<li>Journal records are more robust and should show better information.</li>
	<li>So as not to overload the journal, we do not record  items that you go to by flipping through random items. We only record what kind of Surprise you were looking at and take you back to that media type (verses, art, darshan photos, audio, video).</li>
	<li>The journal will now record and return to any audio you found in Surprise Me or in the top three Listen playlists</li>

<p align="center"><b><font <font size="24"  color="#673227">SivaSivaApp Beta 0.4</font></b></p>
<p></p>
<b>Known Issues: </b><br />
<ul>
	<li>Puzzle may be problematic on Android</li>
	<li>Resume audio from the journal (if it works at all, please look at this carefully) will only take you back to the same talk but will not fast forward to where you left off last time.  We will be able to do this later for downloaded recordings that you listen to offline (coming in Versioin2) </li>
	<li>Offline message may show briefly in low bandwidth situations on start up; but then modules will activate 1 second later. This is due to internet latency with some small phones. We are working on refining this.</li>

<p><b><font color="#673227">Navigation Model/Portals</font></b></p>
<p> Based on our focus group studies, Version one's entry point is the home screen, which is divided into eight "Portals." The first two provide one or two clicks to content for users on the go, for that one minute at the bus stop or down time during a meeting. The other portals take you to second-level navigation. From there you can access specific website areas or view in-app modules. The eight portals are: </p>

<p><b><font color="#673227">Native, In-App Content/Modules</font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Tap to View Photos: </b>We will be offering a complete user guide in future releases. But one pointer is that we have rich still imagery throughout the app. In most contexts you can tap on the image to see the full image, or a cropped view or see the image behind the text. Try it, for example, right here: click outside the text on the photo and then click again to return to the app. One goal of this app is to provide uplifting and often stunning imagery.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Gems: </b>This is a one click to content module for users on the go. The entirety of the Trilogy books, Dancing with Siva, Living with Siva and Merging with Siva, Vedic quotes and more have been extracted into small quotes. These are categorized into three realms: Realm of God, Realm of Soul and Realm of Life. Random selections are delivered along with random images. If you have a live internet connection, you can click the icon and be presented with the chapter of the book from which the quote was taken.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Surprise Me: </b> This is another one-click-to-content module. It will bring up a randomly selected  quote, an audio or video clip, or a darshan image.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Listen: </b>You do need to be online to stream the audio. Version one provides in-app curated play lists. Later we will offer a download option to save files on your phone.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Color Meditation: </b> The first of many "Practice" modules, this is a simple color-based meditation practice that Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami taught.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Word Puzzles: </b> Under the Fun &amp; Games portal we have only one item at present. Be careful, this word puzzle game is addictive. We welcome your feedback on how to make it better.</p>
