<ul type="disc">
<li>iOS phones and iPads</li>
<li> Android: still not ready, sorry. Coming soon.
</li>
<li>Optimized for 9 X 16 (portrait orientation) or 16 X 9 screens</li>
<li>By design, the content is optimized for mobile phones. The app will run on tablets, but much of the content is, again, by design, non-responsive. This means 3 X 4 tablets will see the content rendered in a 16 X 9 area.
</li>

	<ul>
			<li>Impediments to iPad installation removed</li>
			<li>Background execution enabled. SivaSiva app no longer automatically quits when you go to another app on your device. You could be reading the daily lesson, in the middle of a puzzle or listening to a song. If you have to stop and take a phone call, or switch to Instagram or email etc. you can click back on SivaSiva app and return exactly where you left off.  We decided, for now, unless here it huge demand, not to have background audio on, as not all users appreciate having the sound continue when they leave the app.  Background audio will continue in app itself. Hit the gear and the audio icon to turn it off.</li>
			<li>Portals screen fixed to scroll smoothly</li>
			<li>Portal screens color themes upgraded</li>
			<li>Major change in the navigation engine. It now moves directly from one module to another with no "in between" screen</li>
			<li>Tap zones for many arrows enlarged so that app feels more responsive. You don't have to touch the arrow exactly for the app to respond. (Still more to do there) </li>
			<li>Upgraded image quality on portal screens</li>
			<li>By popular request: major change to Surprise module: when viewing a collection of quotes, moving forward will choose another random quote, but from the same collection.</li>
			<li>Journal entries for Surprise model more robust in returning to the media you were at; but still random selection. For verses you return to the collection you were in.</li>
			<li>Fixed a crash problem with moving in and out of the Journal. We needed to simplify the engineering behind this, so the back arrow on the Journal always takes you Home, unless you go to a web page via the Journal, in which case the back arrow will take you back to the Journal.</li>
			<li>Fixed a probem in Surprise Audio where rapidly tap next arrow to go a different audio would evoke and"Existing controls" error... hopefully this has gone away.</li>
			<li>Cosmetic closure "Aum Tat Sat" added to the end of the daily lesson so users know they have reached the end.</li>
			<li>Known issue:  Still not available for Android</li>
			<li>Known issue:  Some contexts mysteriously require two clicks to get a response. Then later, one will suffice.</li>
