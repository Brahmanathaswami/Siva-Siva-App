<p> <font size="14">Ultimately all credit goes to God, Gods and Guru.  God Siva, is described in the Yoga Sutras as <i>Ishwara</i> who was the first teacher. This app is our humble attempt to be a channel of that divine inspiration that pours as a river of <i>arul</i>, grace from the nameless, formless Divine down to us through time and in this very moment. Reminding us is the whispered ancient mantra of the Saiva Agamas, <i>SivaSiva,</i> which means literally "The Auspicous, The Auspicious."  </font></p>

<p>It was the founder of Kauai's Hindu Monastery, Gurudeva, Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, who first ordered computers for his monks as early as 1985. He called one of the monks at his monastery in San Franscisco and said "Your Apple II is coming, go and get some classes on how to use it. This is the future."  That young monk opened the computer and booted up a program called "Hypercard" and wrote his first lines of code and never looked back. By 1995 we had content up web servers on the early days of the internet.  Today this app uses a mix of  21 century xTalk in the form LiveCode, HTML5, SVG, and audio/visual content leveraged largely with Adobe Creative Suite and draws on talents and skills of professionals and volunteers in six different countries.
