<p align="center"><b><font size="20">Overview</font></b></p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p> The SivaSiva App is follows the model of the popular Asian "Megaapp" &mdash; which is like going to a giant super mall, a one space in which many needs are met. It is one large app that serves multiple needs that once would take many small apps.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A big challenge and requirement for this app comes from the age and interest levels of our users, who range from 14-year-olds who know little about Hinduism, all the way up to 80-year-old devotees who are knowledgeable and dedicated Saivite Hindus steeped in the tradition. Currently we have little content for small children. This will change in future versions, as we find ways to add modules that meet the "fun" requirements of both adults and 8-year olds at the same time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes the question is asked, "How is this different from your website?" The answer is that users have limited time to choose from a vast wealth of content, and this app uses a strong "push" model that offers access to the culture and teachings without requiring users to search for things. The SivaSiva app is a curated approach to content delivery, tailoring access to the needs of a mobile generation. (see credits )</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given the breadth of content and user needs, providing navigation and easy access to areas of specific interest is a huge challenge. Version One of the app offers powerful tools, but we still have a long way to go. You can expect more interesting and fun ways to access content in future versions. See the Release Notes for a more detail overview of features and content.</p>
