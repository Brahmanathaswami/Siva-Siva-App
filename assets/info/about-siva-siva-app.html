<p align="center"><b><font size="20">Overview</font></b></p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p>"SivaSiva" is a revered mantra from South India naming the divine within all. This app is a portal to the ancient, profound wisdom and rich culture of that tradition, retooled for the 21st century. It seeks to reach todayâ€™s mobile generation who seek to understand Eastern metaphysics, find spiritual roots and enjoy authentic spiritual experience.</p>
 <p></p>
<p>SivaSiva offers inspirational quotes to uplift your day, awesome photos and art, access to an extensive audio library, YouTube videos and more. Version One has tools for practice and study. Use the app to learn the basics of Saivite Hinduism by diving into the Path to Siva book, which is resident in the app even if you are off line. Read the daily Master Course lessons and practice Color Meditation. The entire current issue of Hinduism Today magazine is available inside the app. Quotes from books give you instant access to their source. A journal tracks your history. Tap favorites to come back to them tomorrow. Have fun with the word-puzzle and learn key concepts at the same time. SivaSiva is a tool for all those who seek daily spiritual upliftment.</p>
<p></p>
<p> The SivaSiva App is follows the model of the popular Asian "Megaapp" &mdash; which is like going to a giant super mall, a one space in which many needs are met. It is one large app that serves multiple needs that once would take many small apps. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A big challenge and requirement for this app comes from the age and interest levels of our users, who range from 14-year-olds who know little about Hinduism, all the way up to 80-year-old devotees who are knowledgeable and dedicated Saivite Hindus steeped in the tradition. Currently we have little content for small children. This will change in future versions, as we find ways to add modules that meet the "fun" requirements of both adults and 8-year olds at the same time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes the question is asked, "How is this different from your website?" The answer is that users have limited time to choose from a vast wealth of content, and this app uses a strong "push" model that offers access to the culture and teachings without requiring users to search for things. It also offers in-app content that the user can access while offline without a connection.  The SivaSiva app is a curated approach to content delivery, tailoring access to the needs of a mobile generation</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given the breadth of content and user needs, providing navigation and easy access to areas of specific interest is a huge challenge. Version One of the app offers powerful tools, but we still have a long way to go. You can expect more interesting and fun ways to access content in future versions, as well as more content that can be accessed when you have no internet connection. When we send out an upgrade, you can to the Release Notes for a more detailed overview of the updates and new features .</p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="20">Navigation Model/Portals</font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p> Based on our focus group studies, Version one's entry point is the home screen, which is divided into eight "Portals." The first two provide one or two clicks to content for users on the go, for that one minute at the bus stop or down time during a meeting. The other portals take you to second-level navigation. From there you can access specific website areas or view in-app modules. The eight portals are: </p>
<p></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p><b>Gems: </b> One click to content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Surprise Me: </b>One click to content</p>
</li>

But one pointer is that we have rich still imagery throughout the app. In most contexts you can tap on the image to see the full image, or a cropped view or see the image behind the text. Try it, for example, right here: click outside the text on the photo and then click again to return to the app. One goal of this app is to provide uplifting and often stunning imagery.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="18">Gems: </font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a one click to content module for users on the go. The entirety of the Trilogy books, Dancing with Siva, Living with Siva and Merging with Siva, Vedic quotes and more have been extracted into small quotes. These are categorized into three realms: Realm of God, Realm of Soul and Realm of Life. Random selections are delivered along with random images. If you have a live internet connection, you can click the icon and be presented with the chapter of the book from which the quote was taken.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="18">Surprise Me: </font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is another one-click-to-content module. It will bring up a randomly selected  quote, an audio or video clip, or a darshan image.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="18">Listen</font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>"Listen" takes you to portal to our extensive audio collections. This part of the app will continue to be developed into an ever more robust user interface. You do need to be online to stream the audio. Version one provides in-app curated play lists. You can download audio to play off line. Anything you have in your local audio library appears as in a green color on the playlists. Use the 3-Dots in the upper corner for playlists that offer search to options. We will be developing the audio interface extensively in future versions. If you are an avid use of our audio, please send feedback on features you would like to see.</p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="18">Color Meditation</font></b></p>

<p></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="18">Daily Master Course Lesson</font></b></p>

Currently we are recording almost all your actions. We may reduce this in the future. The key to making it easier to "find stuff" is to tap on things that you want to return to and set them as favorites and to use the filters to narrow down the links to where you have been.</p>
