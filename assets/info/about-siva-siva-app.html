<p  style="clear:left;">The first versions of the <i>SivaSiva App</i> provide structured mobile access to the vast resources on our web sites. The SivaSivaApp will provide new models for accessing and interacting with content related Saivite Hinduism that can be quickly viewed, and easily digested in a few minutes. If you have more time, the app provides a gateway for you to dive deep into our media collections.  Later versions will bring new and interesting tools for your spiritual life, practice, study, fun and upliftment, portals to transmit our rich culture and philosophy to the minds of a mobile modern generation of Saivite souls many of who are cut off from their heritage.</p>

<p align="center"><b><font <font size="20"  color="#673227">Overview</font></b></p>
<p> The SivaSivaApp is designed in the model of the popular Asian "Megaapp"  &mdash; the app is like going to a giant super mall. We developed 45 User Personas, created by users themselves and also gleaned through many focus group discussions conducted over two years,  Among the many user requests was "Can we get everything in one app?"   As of summer of 2017 there is also a global trend where analysts are seeing a gradual decline in app installations. Users are getting tired of adding more and more small apps.  Hence, this app has numerous areas/feature, with more to come</p>
<p></p>
<p>A big challenge and requirement for this app comes from the age and interest levels of our users who range from 14-year-old-girls who know little about Hinduism all the way up to 50-80 year old devotees who are already very dedicated Saivite Hindus steeped in the traditions.  With this in mind we decided to limit our content target to assume a literate mind.  This means we presently have very little content for small children. This will change in future versions, as we find was to add modules that meet the "fun" requirements of both adults and 8-year olds at the same time. But Version one assume a fairly high standard of English reading ability.  But, it should be noted that many teenagers as young as 13-15 have today a very strong command of the English language and we provide access to definitions in many contexts.   These "kids" are quite and withdrawn when in the presense of adults, but when we get them in a room together where they are not feeling  shy, you would be surprise at how advance some 11-15 year old minds are today.  We also have a steadily expanding group of non-Hindu users who are exposed more and more to Saivite Hindu culture through yoga practice. Point: we have a very broad user target range. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes the question is asked "How is this different form your web site." The answer is that users are have very short time spans to interact with content, and this app uses a strong "push" model that relieves user from any decision making. We offer small bite size and visual access to the culture and teachings, without requiring users to make a decision to go find things. Of course, for those who *do* want to look into our books, audio and video libraries that access is also available.  But the SivaSiva app is a more pre-curated approach to content delivery, tailoring access to the "immediate/now" needs of a mobile generation. We will be expanding this curated approach in future versions. Preparation of content to meet this bite-sized, pre-curated content has been going on in the background for over two years.

<p></p>
<p>Given the breadth of content and user needs, providing navigation and easy access to areas of specific interest is a huge challenge. Version One of the app offers some tools to make this easier, but we still have a long way to go. You can expect more interesting and fun ways to access content in future versions. Current the app is structured simply with navigation panels that take you to "in-app modules" or to web sites inside the app. See the Release Notes for a more detail overview of featurs and content</p><p></p>
