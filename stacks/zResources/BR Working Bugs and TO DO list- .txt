Mobile Only  bug list 

Noting here things that occur on mobile that we do not see on desktop in IDE

as of Aug 2, 2016

2) moving from home portal to Surprise me... sometimes group scroller fails, why and when?  Something fishy there

3) Surprise me darshan photos are not responding to grab or resize/fit to screen taps... (not on desktop either) this was working. check the media metatdata transformer... I broke something.

4) Surprise me video:  the widget is not being resized to the right location... timing must be off because the rect we set is correct... 

5) Surprise Me video: clicking on the home portal icon works.. the stack rotates to portrait and the home portal is shown in portrait orientation, but if you hit the go back button, the stack remains in landscape size and the Surprise me portal is place in center i.e. fullscreen mode is being implement,but the stack is landscape orientation, but, oddly if you click the video when the screen is in this orientation you go back  and the browser widget is the correct size.

6) going home from the video hapMediaViewLandscape stack... breaks the scroller on the home portal link group.  But if you come back to it.. it works.  Also if you go to our web site and go to the hapMediaViewerPortrait stack.. and back, the scroller does not break! what is the difference?


FEATURE: on surprise me items we want to offer the user option to get another one of that particular media type click for another verse from auvaiyar, click for another pix of GD/BD, click for another audio... skip this for video...
