INDICES/TABLES OF CONTENTS

We have right now a total of twelve screens that will be simply be indices to content.

All these will require a single text field that turns into a clickable list. 

The actual text of top level will vary depending on media type. 

Inspired talks and slide shows are organized by year
Singing by Genre
Art by Artist
etc.

Only in the case of Gurudeva and Bodhinatha's talks would I think an image appropriate. for the rest, flat background are best and we want to use the whole screen top to bottom for the index so that the user is not forced to scroll down unnecessarily

Engineering and usability wise flat full screen backgrounds should serve well for the others. On thing I thought of using were the backgrounds from the trilogy opening pages.
Very soft.. A strong background could be stone patterns.


Design wants to be as minimalist as possible as this is purely navigation across lists and pop-ups.   Engineering wise we just want call two things

1) background image
2) clickable list

UX is simple: clickin the top links replace screen with nextlevel 

Header required on all screens with back and title: The title in the header automatically carries over from the label on the top level portal links.
